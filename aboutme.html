    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am working towards my future. Having a good education to succeed later in life is what matters importantly. Waking up and getting ready each day with gratitude to be able to keep having an education is one of my experiences that put me where I am right now.I am working towards these goals by constantly putting in effort to each of my assignments in school to get a higher grade than what I usually receive. I try my best to stay focused and on task so that I don't fall behind from the others in my class. I consider responsibility and discipline the most necessary values to succeed. Responsibility is such a major thing because its your responsibility to make sure you accomplish everything within the time period that you have. You don't want to pile up missing assignments that will take you ages to accomplish last minute. I also consider discipline an important value because most of the time those who choose not to do the right thing always seem to not do so great.I hope to be able to start saving money. I want to at least have a certain amount before the end of the year. I have a bad habit of constantly spending my money as soon as I receive it. I want to switch things around and actually start being able to save it up.I want to be known as being a kind and humbled person. I want to be known like this because everyone deserves to be treated fairly and if we focus on treating each other nicely then things will start changing everywhere.</p>
